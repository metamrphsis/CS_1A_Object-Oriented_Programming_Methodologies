src/game/GuessOrSink.java
    - Main application prompts the user to enter a predetermined word the program is thinking of. Depending on
      if the letter is being guessed correctly or not, the program either displays the guessed letter in its position
      in the word or draws an ASCII representation of a sinking ship. Once the game is finished, the program provides
      a menu option that asks the user if they want to continue playing the game. If user enters any character, the program
      chooses another word and continues with the game. Otherwise, the program terminates if the user enters 'quit' or 'q'
