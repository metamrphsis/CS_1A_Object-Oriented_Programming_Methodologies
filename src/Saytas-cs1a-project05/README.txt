src/game/GuessOrSink.java
    - Main application prompts the user to enter a guess for a predetermined word. Depending on
      the letter being guessed correctly, the program either displays the guessed letter in its position or
      draws an ASCII representation of a sinking ship. Once the game is finished, the program asks
      the user if they want to continue playing the game again. If yes, the game restarts
      otherwise quits the game.
